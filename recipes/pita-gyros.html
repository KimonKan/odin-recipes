    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pita gyros is one of the most popular street foods in Greece and for good reason. 
        It's stuffed with well-cooked and seasoned meat, garnished with a cooling tzatziki sauce,
        wrapped in a delicious crispy pita, and best of all? It tastes like heaven!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pita bread</li>
        <li>Pork or chicken</li>
        <li>Fried potatoes</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Tzatziki</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare this souvlaki recipe start by preparing the pork gyros. 
            Mix into a large bowl the tenderloin (cut into strips), the garlic, 
            the red onion, 3-4 tbsp of olive oil, 1-2 tbsp of red wine vinegar, 
            some thyme, some rosemary, and mix with your hands. Squeeze the ingredients 
            together, so that all the flavours blend and add 1/2 tbsp of honey. 
            Wrap the bowl and put it into the fridge. Leave the marinade in the fridge 
            for at least 2 hours, before using it (ideally leave it over night).
        </li>
        <li>In a (very hot) large non-sticking pan, add the tenderloin along with the 
            ingredients of the marinade, and sauté for 1 minute on each side, without stirring, 
            until the meat is nicely coloured, crispy and tender inside.
        </li>
        <li>
            To prepare the tzatziki sauce for the pork gyros, pour in a food processor the olive oil 
            and garlic and blend until the garlic is diluted (don’t leave any large pieces of garlic). 
            Into a large bowl, grate the cucumber, season with salt and pepper and leave it aside for 10 minutes
            . Wrap the grated cucumber into a towel and squeeze, in order to get rid of most of the water. 
            Into a bowl, add the cucumber, the blended garlic and oil, the yogurt, 1-2 of red wine vinegar, 
            salt and pepper and mix. (This recipe is for 5-6 servings. Store in the fridge and always serve cold.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a cooking brush to oil the pita breads on both sides and season with salt, pepper and oregano. 
            Place a large pan (upside down) at the bottom of the oven, place the pita breads on top, and bake in 
            preheated oven at 250C for about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>Pork gyros is usually served wrapped, like a sandwich. To serve, spread some tzatziki sauce on the pita 
            breads and top with the pork gyros, some slices of red onion, some sliced tomato and wrap.
        </li>
        <li>
            For an easier version, you can substitute the tzatziki sauce 
            with some fresh yogurt or some mustard and mayonnaise sauce.
        </li>
