    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chickpeas</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Sage leaves</li>
        <li>Sweet red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>From the previous night, soak the chickpeas in a large bowl filled with water and 
            1 tablespoon salt. The water should cover the chickpeas by at least 2 inches.
        </li>
        <li>In a (very hot) large non-sticking pan, add the tenderloin along with the 
            ingredients of the marinade, and sauté for 1 minute on each side, without stirring, 
            until the meat is nicely coloured, crispy and tender inside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drain the chickpeas and discard any that look bad. Sprinkle them with the baking soda
            and mix gently with your hands. Let them rest for 20 minutes and preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Rinse them very well and transfer them and the rest of the ingredients except the onions in a Dutch oven 
            (or an oven-safe pot with a lid) and mix well. Cover the chickpeas with the chopped onions and add 
            enough water to cover them by half an inch.
            Cover with the lid and bake for 3.5 – 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve with barley rusks and Kalamata olives. Eat!
        </li>
